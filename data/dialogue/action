Please help me find my {item}, I left it at {location}.. but the {entity} there.. it took it from me. I need it back.
I heard rumors that in {location}, there are loads and loads of {item}s.. pretty easy way to make money if you ask me.
The last thing I needed today was to be attacked by a group of {entity}s, but here we are. Help me kill them, and I'll give you my {item} as a reward.
The item we need, the {item}, was last rumored to be at {location}, but unfortunately for us, it's guarded by {entity}s. Kill them and we're in.
Head out to {location} and grab as many {item}s as you can find, we only need 15 but anything extra would be helpful.
Kill the {entity} guarding the entrance to {location}, and when you're done, report back to me.
I need you to kill the {entity}s in {location}, and bring me back the {item} I left there.
I need you to find the {entity} guarding the entrance to {location}, and kill it.
Go out and collect some {item}s for me, and I'll give you my {item} as a reward.
