I need you to help me out here and grab 15.. maybe 20 different kinds of herbs.. from the Overgrown Carapace, just outside. Please don't delay.
What we were doing? Oh.. right, right.. just.. hand me that flask over there. It won't be much longer now till you go back home.
Help me! Please! There was an attack, over in the Blasted Meadows, my family is still there, won't you please help them?
What, scared of the undead, you big baby? Just go and kill a few! In the Blasted Meadows! You'll see, it isn't that big of a deal!
