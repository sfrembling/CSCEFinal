Go and find {person} and bring them to {place} for me, will you? I really need to discuss something important with them.
The last thing I needed was for {person} to get involved... damn. Can you find my {thing} for me? It might be the solution to our problem.
To help {person}, he said you'll need to get a few {thing}s and take them to {place}. There, {person} might be able to help you.
Can you grab some {thing}s for me? I only need a few.. maybe 3 would do. You can find them over in {place}.
